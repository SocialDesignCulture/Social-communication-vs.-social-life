<a href="#contents"><strong id="T1" class="enormous">T</strong></a>he aim of this work is to answer the question how technology affects our communication. In order to deeply understand the complexity of this question I would like to start with analysis of what communication really is.
According to the definition given by <a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/communication">Oxford Learner Dictionary </a> the term ‘communication’</div>

<p class="communication">

“/kəˌmyunəˈkeɪʃn/” </p>
                                                                                       
<p>has three meanings: ways to express ideas or feelings (process), ways of sending information via various sources (system along with technology) and means also those sources themselves as well as the content itself being spread (tools and means): 
<ul>
            <li>“[uncountable] the activity or process of expressing ideas and feelings or of giving people information. <em>Speech is the fastest method of communication between people. All channels of communication need to be kept open. Doctors do not always have good <strong>communication skills</strong>. Nonverbal communication. We are in regular communication by mail.</em></li>
            
            <li>[uncountable] <strong>communications </strong> [plural] methods of sending information, especially telephones, radio, computers, etc. or roads, and railroads <em><strong>communication systems/links/technology</strong>. The new airport will improve communications between the islands. Snow has prevented communication with the outside world for three days.</em></li>
            <li>[countable] <em>(formal) </em>a message, letter or telephone call <em>a communication from the president of the company.</em></li>
</ul>

<a href="#contents"> <strong id="T2"class="enormous" >T</strong></a>he term means a lot and this understanding can be used separately at all these mentioned above levels in order to cover ‘this new thing’ indication tool (communication). That’s why nowadays we have so many forms of communication in everyday life with the old ones at which we glance back with sentiment or maybe astonishment.  The civilized world has come through a big transformation and  revolution. The last one that helped us communicate with each other was industrial revolution (more related to travelling though) and the current one we are going through is the digital revolution when services and devices such as Internet along with computers and mobile phones replaced earlier forms:  telegraph, post, television and finally traditional cable telephone. The interactions between people had their consequences resulting in creating the sources for maintaining and showing  <u>phatic function</u> of the language, indicating the need of keeping contact, and what comes out of this, sharing information for education, safety, curiosity and even entertainment reasons. <br><br>
<a href="#contents"><strong id="L"class="enormous">L</strong></a>iving in XXI century triggers possessing awareness about interaction between technology and humanity which can look like living in symbiosis as technology seems to fill the room  - ‘life’ of human beings and the way they share this room with others. The technology stands nowadays right beside a human, simplifying their life, always being ready like a servant to help, yet it also seems to act like a shadow (‘I am not moving without my phone’ phrase became major upset and main communication catchword), always following human and simultaneously being indissociable. It started also to define the human  in such a way that it has its impact on his identity -  social identity (the way how we see each other and how others perceive us because of positive or negative presence on social media channels for instance), but it also influences human’s psychological identity, if we look at how the humans could do without them  (are we in fact prisoners of this communication? Or prisoners of our curiosity always at 'on' mode?).<br><br>

<a href="#contents"><strong id="A1"class="enormous">A</strong></a>n interesting example of such net of dependencies, yet referred to human self-esteem in relation to social media sub-world is the episode of <strong>Black mirror series </strong>called <strong><em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/ie/title/70264888">Nosedive</a></em></strong>. The human is presented there as lost and hopeless in their trials to achieve what is expected by others and not possible by this individual, surprisingly not even  really wanted...  We could quote here an old famous sitcom: Keeping up appearances. The human despite living in a new generation seems to remain in the same constraints in relation to ‘what others say about me’. But the real life is not a comedy here. Media presence and ranking start to have impact on real private life of the character - not getting a mortgage because of insufficient number of followers, i.e. recognition what reflects in not enough trust in them. The frustration and rebellion are emotions that evoke in characters  more and more. The question arises here then, if we live in the world or system, if the world is just communicated or maybe we talk about well designed (communicated) system we live in. Hence, we may think of negative aspect of communication technology here: tracing all its participants and depriving them of living unnoticeably, giving them the room only to appear in a rigid structure. Ability to trace, delivers bank of data and those data can be measured and then used in conceivable for us or non-conceivable way. The question arises here: can everything be measured? Should it be measured? Who controls the data? And are they protected? 
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism"> <img id="transhumanism" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Biohacker_Neil_Harbisson.jpg/255px-Biohacker_Neil_Harbisson.jpg" width="auto"></a><br>
Well, we could also question the behaviour of the community as the whole: why are they so susceptible to undergo such rankings? Don’t they see the boundary between legal formal and personal subjective grade based of tastes and mood? <br>

Is humanity than somehow unaware or maybe blind in long term leading to <em> <strong> transhumanism </strong> </em> by fraternizing with what technological outcome will be delivered?

 <a target="_blank" href="https://wifflegif.com/gifs/564573-scientific-illustration-transhumanism-gif"><img id="transhumanism2" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/16af2231f7da3ce1d77d63e2e8f1c0d5/tumblr_nbv0xqRgz51ra0nrho1_500.gif"width="auto"></a><br>

<p id="pod-zdjeciem"></p><a href="#contents"><strong id="A2"class="enormous">A</strong></a>nother communication system can be found around real estates, the system term is evoked here intentionally, and it is also determined nowadays wherever we are. In big clusters evidently has its place in a form of surveillance cameras (CCTV) detecting our single move, probably registering it, to finally control it. For their good and bad, what leads us to think if our life still stays free and independent, and somehow slack...  
The programs of data protection seem to be an answer to these doubts (Health, Safety & Welfare Act and Communications). Definitely, there is a source of help for misused data and information, but we must equip ourselves with time and energy as the battle with big and ruling companies may be slowly efficient, if at all. And without any protection from the law makers and executives (also state ones or those fighting for good and right, not money), it may not be achievable. </p>

<a href="#contents"><strong id="C"class="enormous">C</strong></a>ommunication is probably different in big cities and in rural areas where life seems to slow down and be more connected with nature, also defined more by face to face contacts in real than online hanging out. Many outer verbal signs like body language or feeling the mood of the interlocutor may be missing in Internet interactions. The energetic connection is lost.

We may ask if with the progressing communication erases independence, freedom, informality. And in place of this appears organized group over individual? Can it have later impact on diminishing individuality? So collected by Internet data can be used as a form of manipulation for mass. And when we take into consideration how easy it may be because of transhumanistic vulnerability of mankind, the future of people may not be difficult to guess. By the way, are flights to cosmos somehow related to transhumanistic nature of people? The nature of will to become someone else, the curiosity that crosses natural limits and aligns so close with technology and something that is always somehow far?<br>

The modern world by its diversity and hidden manipulation on every step in ‘our room’ and in advertisements where our mental lives become more fragmented, poses a question if we can maintain a coherent self, somehow untouched by flooding us with information from every corner. This is our attention, on which level this fight for us takes place, because our attention (time) determines someone’s profit and success. Not to mention energy loss we experience in behalf of this source.<br><br>

<a href="#contents"><strong id="Th3"class="enormous">T</strong></a>he freedom of staying out of so communicated world but with taking benefits of this big world may be a trial of nowadays  media, maybe those more alternative. They in contrast to main stream media stay away from general forms of expression shed by big companies and their think-tanks. Yet, it is hard to predict if they are showing the real word because truth not scientific one remains an opinion, hence it’s somehow relevant. <br><br>

<a href="#contents"><strong class="enormous">A</strong></a>nother source of communication may be Al – artificial intelligence. Crossing barrier between a smart device and self-driven device in changing setting (changing world) leads to distinguish another factor that determines a human: techhumanoid – thinking technology. With Al it went that far that many articles are written now by machines, not by humans. And they seem to be very convincing in terms of content they present. But in order to determine whether it is fake or true, we need to be equipped with a very strong knowledge about a particular field. The information chaos which is then created is more difficult to spot and identify. 
The question here stays, if human’s life progresses as fast as occurs the progress in industrial/ digital revolution and if this revolution will not rebel against humans – if not physically like presented in many movies, then informatively causing human’s room  to become sort of rubbish and clutter. Maybe the next more suitable human approach to surrounding world will be: <br>
<div id="I-dont">
<em> <u> I don't believe, I don't trust, I don't know (if some story is true). <br></u></em>And additionally <em> <u> I don't care!</u></em></div><br>
The entire society is somehow compelled now to ask a new very old question: what does it mean to be a human?<br><br>
